# Flowers â€“ Language of Blooms

This project is a visual presentation of flowers built using only HTML and CSS.
It showcases flowers like Lotus, Rose, Sunflower, Lily, Tulip, and Daisy with descriptive cards, images, and headings.

The layout uses Flexbox to arrange cards evenly across the page, creating a clean and organized design.
CSS styling includes border-radius, box-shadow transitions, hover effects, text-decoration, and text-shadow for a visually appealing look.
Each flower card highlights unique symbolism and storytelling.

The project demonstrates practical skills in card layouts, typography, hover animations, and responsive structuring.

Assets are stored in the Flower-Assets folder to keep the project organized.

It is part of a collection of HTML and CSS mini-projects aimed at improving front-end development skills.
