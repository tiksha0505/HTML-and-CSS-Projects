    <h1 id="heading">Flowers - Language of Blooms</h1>
    <p id="desc"> 
        Every flower tells a story - not just through its color or petals, 
        but in the way it stands, grows, and brings peace. They speak of strength, 
        simplicity, love, and light. 
        In their quiet presence, they remind us what it means to truly bloom. <br> <br> Let's explore them, one bloom at a time.

                <p>
                    <b>Lotus - Grace Reborn</b> <br>
                    Rising untouched from the mud, 
                    the lotus is a symbol of quiet strength 
                    and inner peace. It blooms with dignity, 
                    reminding us that beauty often grows through struggle. 
                    A gentle queen of still waters.

                <p>
                    <b>Rose - Timeless Love</b> <br>
                    The rose isn't just petals and scent,
                    it's strength wrapped in softness. It opens slowly, 
                    revealing itself one layer at a time, and still protects 
                    itself with thorns. 
                    A reminder that love, like life, can be both delicate and brave.

                    <b>Sunflower - Golden Soul</b> <br>
                    Sunflowers have this way of turning toward the sun -
                    always hopeful, always reaching. 
                    They're not just beautiful, they're brave. Tall, bright, and full of life. 
                    Like joy, standing proudly in a field.

                    <b>Lily - Pure Elegance</b> <br> 
                    A gentle bloom that carries the calm of early morning. 
                    It stands with quiet grace, each petal soft like whispered prayers. 
                    In quiet corners, it glows - not to dazzle, but to soothe.

                    <b>Tulip - Gentle Joy</b> <br>
                    Tulips feel like little bursts of happiness. 
                    They don't complicate things - they just show up with color, 
                    warmth, and the comfort of spring days. 
                    Like a friend who doesn't need many words to make you smile.

                    Daisies remind you of simpler times, hands full of flowers, 
                    laughter in the air, and bare feet in the grass. There's nothing 
                    loud about them, and that's the point. 
                    Their beauty is in their honesty.
