# Cafe Sidebar Mini Project

This project is a café-themed sidebar navigation page built using HTML and CSS.
It features a collapsible sidebar that slides in and out using a hidden checkbox toggle, so it works without any JavaScript.

The sidebar includes links for sections like Café Treats, Café Sips, Our Journey, Gallery, Locate Us, and Place Your Treats, along with social media icons in the footer.

CSS is used to style the sidebar, menu items, hover effects, and transitions for smooth animations.
The layout includes a background image, styled typography, and custom fonts from Google Fonts.
The project demonstrates positioning, hover effects, transitions, responsive sidebar design, and creative use of checkbox toggling.

Assets are stored in the Cafe-Assets folder to keep the project organized.

This mini-project is part of a collection of HTML and CSS projects to practice front-end styling and layout concepts.
