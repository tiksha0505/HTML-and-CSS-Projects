# Pet Adoption Project â€“ AdoptMe

This project is a pet adoption showcase page built using HTML and CSS.

It features cards for adoptable pets with images, names, and descriptive stories about each pet.

The layout uses Flexbox to arrange the cards evenly, with responsive design for smaller screens.
CSS styling includes borders, border-radius, padding, text formatting, and color highlights for headings and links.

Each card tells the personality and needs of the pet, combining visual appeal with storytelling.

The project demonstrates skills in card layouts, typography, responsive design, and CSS styling for images and text.

Assets like pet images are stored in the Pet-adoption-Assets folder to keep the project organized.

This mini-project is part of a collection of HTML and CSS projects to practice front-end development concepts.
