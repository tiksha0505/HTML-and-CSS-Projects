# Spotify Clone – Web Player

This project is a Spotify-like web player built entirely with HTML and CSS.

It includes a responsive navigation bar, sidebar for the library, main content area with albums and playlists, and a music player footer.

The layout is created using Flexbox and absolute positioning for precise placement of elements.
Interactive elements like badges, buttons, and hover effects make the experience dynamic and visually appealing.
The player section features album images, song info, playback controls, progress bar, and volume control.

All assets such as logos, album covers, and control icons are stored in the Spotify-Assets folder.

This project demonstrates skills in CSS layout, positioning, styling, and responsive design.

It’s part of a collection of HTML and CSS mini-projects aimed at strengthening front-end development concepts.
